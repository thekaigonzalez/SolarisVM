SIBC (Solaris Intermediate Bytecode Compiler) source code

    Works hand-in-hand with SLRI, the Solaris Low-level Runtime Interface

    Contains:
      * sasm (Solaris Assembler)

    VOLT has faster compilation times than SASM, but is much less powerful and
    stable.

    SASM generates ASTs, which are directly compiled into bytecode.

    Supports NexFUSE, OpenLUD, MercuryPIC, and the Solaris Bytecode format.
