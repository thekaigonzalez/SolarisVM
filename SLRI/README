Solaris Low-Level Runtime Interface (SLRI)

  Contains source code for the Solaris bytecode format

  CPUs contain a fast I/O stack, as well as 256 registers, and 256 sections
  (NOTE: unused)

  You can either use solrun or solrun-tiny, which can either sacrafice
  performance over binary size or vice versa.

Contains standard functions to generate proper control flow and sequencing.
